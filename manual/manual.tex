\section{Introduction}

OPTRAGEN is not a medicine :-), but a MATLAB toolbox that numerically solves
optimal control problems. OPTRAGEN translates optimal control problems of the
form
\[ \min_{x ( t ), u ( t )} \Phi_i ( x ( t_0 ), u ( t_0 ), t_0 ) +
   \int_{t_0}^{t_f} \Phi_t ( x ( t ), u ( t ), t ) d \tau + \Phi_f ( x ( t_f
   ), u ( t_f ), t_f ) \]
subject to dynamics
\[ \dot{x} = f ( x, u, t ) \]
and constraints
\[ \begin{array}{cccccc}
     l_i & \leq & \Psi_i ( x ( t_0 ), u ( t_0 ), t_0 ) & \leq & u_i & (
     \textit{Initial Constraint})\\
     l_t & \leq & \Psi_t ( x ( t_{} ), u ( t_{} ), t_{} ) & \leq & u_t & (
     \textit{Trajectory Constraint} )\\
     l_f & \leq & \Psi_f ( x ( t_f ), u ( t_f ), t_f ) & \leq & u_f & (
     \textit{Final Constraint} ),
   \end{array} \]
to nonlinear programming problems of the form
\[ \min_{\rho} F ( \rho ) \]
subject to
\[ \begin{array}{ccccc}
     L & \leq & \left\{ \begin{array}{c}
       \rho\\
       A \rho\\
       G ( \rho )
     \end{array} \right\} & \leq & U.
   \end{array} \]
The transcription of optimal control problem (OCP) to nonlinear
programming (NLP) problem is done by parameterising trajectories as
Splines. The output of the transcription is a cost function and a
constraint function that can be interfaced with any commercially
available nonlinear programming solver. OPTRAGEN can be considered
to be a parser that translates optimal control problems to nonlinear
programming problems, and is \textit{not} dependent on any nonlinear
programming solver.

\section{Dependencies}

OPTRAGEN requires the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item MATLAB Barebones

  \item MATLAB Symbolic Computing Toolbox

  \item MATLAB Spline Toolbox
\end{itemize}
To solve the transcribed nonlinear programming problem, a nonlinear
programming solver is needed. Recommended solver is SNOPT, since the
resulting nonlinear programming problem is {\textit{sparse}}.
Examples provided with this toolbox demonstrates interface with
SNOPT. A free, student version of SNOPT is available from Philip
Gill's website at Univ. California, San Diego.

\section{Installation}

  {\textbf{Step 1:}} Unzip it in a desired directory.  Avoid unzipping
  under directories with space in the name, e.g. \texttt{C:/Program
  Files/etc}. It will create directory \texttt{optragen/} under the present working
  directory. Under \texttt{optragen/}, there will be
  subdirectories:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textsf{doc/} : contains documentation
    \item \texttt{src/} : contains source files for OPTRAGEN
    \item \texttt{examples/} : contains examples that demonstrate use of this
    toolbox\\
  \end{enumerate}


  In the \texttt{examples/} directory, there will be directories:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \texttt{vanderpol/} : fixed final time optimal control problem
    \item \texttt{brachistochrone/} : open final time optimal control problem
    \item \texttt{pathplanning/} : obstacle avoidance in 2D\\
  \end{enumerate}

\textbf{Step 2:} Put \texttt{optragen/src/} in the MATLAB path. \\

\textbf{Step 3:} Put SNOPT in MATLAB path, if you are using SNOPT.

\section{Changes in Version 2}
The two main changes in this version are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Complete vectorization of code. This has reduced the
computational time considerably.
\item Dynamical constraints can now be imposed via Galerkin
projections. See vanderpol example under
\texttt{optragen/examples/vanderpol/vanderpol\_galerkin.m}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Parameterisation of Trajectory Space}

Trajectories in OPTRAGEN are parameterised as Splines. A Spline is
defined by a set of polynomials that are stitched at predefined
break points, satisfying a given degree of smoothness. Splines are
approximating functions of choice for $f ( t )$, when approximation
is desired over a large interval.\\


The large interval $[ t_0, t_f ]$ is subdivided into sufficiently
small intervals $[ \xi_i, \xi_{i + 1} ]$, with $t_0 = \xi_1 < \cdots
< \xi_N = t_f.$ The points $\xi_i$ are called \textit{break points}
or \textit{knot  points}. On each such interval, polynomial of
relatively low degree can provide a good approximation to $f ( t )$.
Approximation over smaller intervals offers \textit{local
support}.\\

The different polynomial pieces can be constructed such that the
resulting composite function has several continuous derivatives over
the interval boundaries or the break points. The number of
continuous derivatives across the breakpoints defines the
\textit{smoothness} condition of the spline.\\

  \textbf{Remark 1:} The continuity of the resulting curve {\textit{at the break points}} is
    determined by the smoothness condition.\\

    \textbf{Remark 2:} The continuity of the resulting curve {\textit{in between the break
      points}} is determined by the order of the polynomial
      pieces.\\

\begin{figure}[h]
\centerline{\epsfig{file=spline.pdf,width=3in}} \caption{Splines and
polynomial pieces.} \label{fig.splines}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig.splines} shows a spline curve composed of four
polynomial pieces $P_1, P_2, P_3$ and $P_4$. They are joined at
break points A,B and C. Splines can be represented in a
computationally efficient manner using normalised B-Splines. For a
more information on Splines, the reader is directed to:

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item {\textit{The MATLAB Spline Toolbox Manual}}
    \item {\textit{Practical Guide to Splines}}, by Carl de Boor, Springer
    Verlag Publication.
  \end{enumerate}

Next we present trajectory parameterisation using B-Splines.

\section{B-Splines }
  A B-Spline curve is defined as
  \[ f ( t ) = \sum_{k = 1}^{N_c} \alpha_k B_{k, r} ( t ) \]
  where
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $\alpha_k$ are the free parameters or the degrees of freedom

    \item $N_c$ is the number of free parameters defined by $N_c = N \times (
    r - s ) + s$

    \item $N$ is the number of intervals or the number of polynomial pieces

    \item $r$ is the degree of the polynomial pieces

    \item $s$ is the smoothness condition at the breakpoints

    \item $B_{k, r} ( t )$ are the basis functions, see MATLAB Spline Toolbox
    manual for definition
  \end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centerline{\epsfig{file=Bsplines.pdf,width=3in}} \caption{A
  Spline curve as a composite of B-Splines.}
\label{fig.BSplines}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig.BSplines} shows the same spline as in figure
  \ref{fig.splines} as a composite of B-Splines.


\section{Transcription of Optimal Control Problem to Nonlinear Programming
Problem}

The transcription is achieved in the following manner:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The unknown trajectories are parameterised as B-Splines

  \item The optimisation problem is then written in terms of the B-Spline
  coefficients $\alpha_k$.

  \item Costs and constraints are evaluated and enforced at the
  \textit{collocation points}.

  \item The collocation points are {\textit{different}} from the break points.
  In general, the collocation points are more dense than the break points. The
  optimal set of collocation points can be determined from the order of the
  spline using the \textit{Gaussian Quadrature} formula. See MATLAB Spline
  Toolbox manual, pg 2-45 (example on solving a nonlinear ODE using Splines).
\end{itemize}
Figure \ref{fig.transcription} illustrates the transcription process.

\section{Collocation}
\subsection{Gaussian Quadrature}

  The Gaussian quadrature formula seeks to obtain the best numerical estimate
  of an integral by picking the optimal abscissae $x_i$ at which to evaluate
  $f ( x )$. The fundamental theorem of Gaussian quadrature states that the
  optimal abscissae of the $m$-point Gaussian quadrature formulas are
  precisely the roots of the orthogonal polynomial for the same interval and
  weighting function. Gaussian quadrature is optimal because it fits all
  polynomials up to degree $2 m$ exactly. Slightly less optimal fits are
  obtained from Radau quadrature and Laguerre quadrature. \\

  If the weighting function is chosen to be $1$ and the interval $[ - 1, 1 ]$,
  then Legendre polynomials are the orthogonal functions whose roots are the
  Gaussian sites. A Legendre polynomials of order $r$ is represented by $P_r (
  x )$. The first few Legendre polynomials are:

\[ \begin{array}{rcl}
     P_0 ( x ) & = & 1\\
     P_1 ( x ) & = & x\\
     P_2 ( x ) & = & \frac{1}{2} ( 3 x^2 - 1 )\\
     P_3 ( x ) & = & \frac{1}{2} ( 5 x^3 - 3 x )\\
     P_4 ( x ) & = & \frac{1}{8} ( 35 x^4 - 30 x^2 + 3 )\\
     P_5 ( x ) & = & \frac{1}{8} ( 63 x^5 - 70 x^3 + 15 x )\\
     P_6 ( x ) & = & \frac{1}{16} ( 231 x^6 - 315 x^4 + 105 x^2 - 5 )
   \end{array} \]

\subsection{Chebyshev-Gaussian-Labatto Points}

Chebyshev-Gaussian-Labato (CGL) points can also be used to determine the
collocation points. CGL points in the interval $[ - 1, 1 ]$ are
\[ t_k = \cos ( \pi k / N ), k = 0, \ldots, N. \]
These points are the extreme of the $N^{th}$ order Chebyshev
polynomial. The $i^{th}$ order Chebyshev polynomial is expressed by
\[ T_i ( t ) = \cos ( i \cos^{- 1} t ) . \]

\section{Examples}
\subsection{Vanderpol Oscillator : Fixed Final Time}

Consider the following optimisation problem based on the Vanderpol oscillator.
\[ \min \int_0^5 ( x_1^2 + x_2^2 + u^2 ) d t \]
subject to the dynamics
\[ \begin{array}{rcl}
     \dot{x}_1 & = & x_2\\
     \dot{x}_2 & = & - x_1 + ( 1 - x_1 )^2 x_2 + u
   \end{array} \]
and constraints
\[ \begin{array}{rcl}
     x_1 ( 0 ) & = & 1\\
     x_2 ( 0 ) & = & 0\\
     - x_1 ( 5 ) + x_2 ( 5 ) & = & 1
   \end{array} \]
The optimisation problem has
\begin{itemize}
  \item one trajectory or integral cost function

  \item two initial linear constraints

  \item one final linear constraint

  \item one linear trajectory or path constraint

  \item one nonlinear trajectory or path constraint
\end{itemize}
The problem can be formulated as a numerical optimisation problem in more than
one way, depending on the trajectories that are parameterised.

\subsubsection{Over Parameterisation}
If we choose to over parameterise the problem by parameterising $x_1 ( t ), y
( t )$ and $u ( t )$ as B-Splines, then the dynamics of the system should
constrain the behaviour of these trajectories. Since the constraints are
satisfied at the collocation points, a sparse distribution of collocation
points will result in trajectories that does not approximate the Vanderpol
oscillator system satisfactorily. The optimal distribution is given by the
Gaussian quadrature formula. Note that this approach will lead to a large
number of equality constraints. Therefore, the optimisation problem has to
have a large number of free parameters for feasibility.

\subsubsection{Differential Flatness}
  The Vanderpol problem can be formulated as an optimisation problem on a
  single trajectory as compared to three trajectory variables as shown
  previously. The Vanderpol system exhibits a property called
  \textit{differential flatness}. Choosing $z ( t ) \equiv x ( t )$ as the
  flat output we can rewrite the optimisation problem as follows:
  \[ \min_{z ( t )}  \int^5_0 [ z^2 + \dot{z}^2 + \{ \ddot{z} + z - ( 1 - z^2
     ) \dot{z} \}^2 ] d t \]
  subject to constraints
  \[ \begin{array}{rcl}
       z ( 0 ) & = & 1\\
       \dot{z} ( 0 ) & = & 0\\
       - z ( 5 ) + \dot{z} ( 5 ) & = & 1
     \end{array} \]
  In this formulation, the dynamics of the system is implicitly enforced. It
  gets rid of the unnecessary equality path constraints which are hard to
  satisfy and may lead to infeasibility for a small number of B-Spline
  coefficients. Therefore, exploitation of differential flatness helps in
  reducing the problem complexity in terms of the number of constraints due to
  system dynamics and the number of trajectories required to define the
  problem.\\

  Having said so, it is also important to note that formulation with flat
  outputs may lead to numerically sensitive problems. Typically, when flatness
  is exploited the state and conrol variables of the system are complicated
  algebraic functions of the flat outputs. Numerical optimisation with such
  functions may lead to singularity problems for naively imposed state and
  control constraints.\\

  Clearly, there is a tradeoff in the choice of formulation. In some cases, it
  may not be a good idea to exploit flatness even if possible. It may be
  computationally feasible to over parameterise the system in the formulation.
  The choice of formulation is problem dependent and it is not possible to
  rank them in general in terms of computational efficiency, numerical
  conditioning, etc.


\subsubsection{Construction of the Trajectory Space}
The trajectory space is defined by the number of intervals $n$, the
smoothness condition $s$ and the order of the polynomial $r$. It is
important to select these parameters carefully. For the
differentially flat system we observe that the highest derivative of
the flat output that appears in the formulation is two, i.e.
$\ddot{z}$. If it is desired that $\ddot{z}$ is atleast twice
differentiable, then the smoothness condition for $z ( t )$ should
be $s = 5$, resulting in $z ( t ) \in C^{s - 1}$. The order of the
spline $r$ has to be atleast $s$. The number of intervals $n$ and
the order $r$ can be tuned to make sure that the problem has
sufficient degrees of freedom. The order of the spline also
determines the number of collocation points necessary. This is
determined from the Gaussian quadrature formula.\\

\begin{figure}[h]
\centerline{\epsfig{file=vanderpol.pdf,width=4in}} \caption{Fixed
final time optimal control problem.} \label{fig.vanderpol}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig.vanderpol} shows the optimal solution for $n = 1, s
= 4$ and $r = 5$. The optimal cost is $2.4751$ and it took 0.172
seconds to run in a Pentium 4, 2Ghz machine running Windows XP. The
optimisation environment is MATLAB based. Computational time is
expected to improve of the same problem is implemented using ANSI C
programming language.\\

The solution shown in figure \ref{fig.vanderpol} is really the
suboptimal solution, since optimality has been determined in the
subspace of $z ( t )$ defined by the choices of $n, s$ and $r$.
Changing $n, s$ and $r$  will change the suboptimal solution.\\

\subsection{The Classical Brachistochrone Problem : Open Final Time}
The problem is defined as follows. A bead slides on a frictionless
wire between two points $A ( x_0, y_0 )$ and $B ( x_f, y_f )$ in a
constant-gravity field. The bead has an initial velocity $V_0$ at
point A. What is the shape of the wire that will produce a
minimum-time path between the two points? For formulation details
please refer to \textit{Applied Optimal Control: Optimization,
Estimation and Control} by Arthur E. Bryson, Jr. and Yu-Chi Ho.\\

The problem is defined by the following optimisation problem

\[ \min t_f \]
such that
\[ \begin{array}{rcl}
     \dot{x} & = & V ( y ) \cos ( \theta )\\
     \dot{y} & = & V ( y ) \sin ( \theta )\\
     V ( y ) & = & \sqrt{V_0^2 + 2 g y}\\
     x ( 0 ) & = & 0\\
     y ( 0 ) & = & 0\\
     x ( t_f ) & = & x_f\\
     y ( t_f ) & = & y_f
   \end{array} \]
Since the final time is unknown, it has to be a parameter of optimisation.
Constants are parameterised as splines with $n = 1, s = 0, r = 1.$ The problem
is then normalised with respect to time. For this we define the normalised
time to be $\tau = t / t_f$, where $t_f$ is the unknown constant. Time
derivatives are scaled appropriately as
\[ \frac{d}{d t} = \frac{1}{t_f} \frac{d}{d \tau} \]
The problem with normalised time is therefore
\[ \min t_f \]
subject to
\[ \begin{array}{rcl}
     \frac{d x}{d \tau} & = & t_f V ( y ) \cos ( \theta )\\
     \frac{d y}{d \tau} & = & t_f V ( y ) \sin ( \theta )\\
     V ( y ) & = & \sqrt{V_0^2 + 2 g y}\\
     x ( 0 ) & = & 0\\
     y ( 0 ) & = & 0\\
     x ( 1 ) & = & x_f\\
     y ( 1 ) & = & y_f
   \end{array} \]
The problem can be solved by parametersing $\theta ( \tau )$, but
that will require numerical integration of the dynamics to determine
$x ( \tau ), y ( \tau )$. Numerical integration in optimisation
problems tend to be time consuming and inaccurate, especially when
constraints are defined on the integrated function.\\

For this problem we over parameterise the system and chose $x ( \tau
), y ( \tau )$ to be the variables of optimisation. The trajectories
are constrained by the dynamics. Since derivatives of splines are
easily computable, derivative constraints can be easily implemented.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centerline{\epsfig{file=brachi.pdf,width=4in}} \caption{Open final
time optimal control problem.} \label{fig.brachi}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig.brachi} shows the suboptimal solution of the
Brachistochrone problem. This is obtained using $n = 3, s = 2, r =
4$ for $x ( \tau ), y ( \tau )$ and $n = 1, s = 0, r = 1$ for $t_f$.
The minimum time is 0.3270 and it took 2.266 seconds to compute in a
MATLAB environment. \\

This problem has an analytical solution. It turns out that the
minimum time trajectories are cycloids where $\theta ( t )$ is a
linear function of time. Figure \ref{fig.brachi} shows almost linear
variation for suboptimal $\theta ( t ) .$ Deviation is due to the
errors in imposing the dynamics as  constraints. Increasing
collocation points and number of intervals is expected to bring this
error down, at the cost of increased computational time.\\

\subsection{Robot Motion Planning : Obstacle Avoidance}
In this example we consider motion planning for a robot with obstacles in 2D
space. Let us assume that it is desired that the robost goes from point $A (
x_0, y_0 )$ to $B ( x_f, y_f )$ avoiding circular obstacles in the way and
using minimum energy. This is cast as the following optimisation problem.


\[ \min \int_0^1 ( \dot{x}^2 + \dot{y}^2 ) d t \]
subject to
\[ \begin{array}{rcl}
     \dot{x} & = & V \cos \theta\\
     \dot{y} & = & V \sin \theta\\
     x ( 0 ) & = & 0\\
     y ( 0 ) & = & 0\\
     x ( 1 ) & = & 1.2\\
     y ( 1 ) & = & 1.6\\
     ( x ( t ) - 0.4 )^2 + ( y ( t ) - 0.5 )^2 & \geq & 0.1^{}\\
     ( x ( t ) - 0.8 )^2 + ( y ( t ) - 1.5 )^2 & \geq & 0.1
   \end{array} \]
The last two constraints model circular obstacles that must be avoided.

Figure \ref{fig.obstacle} shows the optimal trajectory generated
with the obstacles at $( 0.4, 0.5 )$ and $( 0.8, 1.5 )$ and radius
0.3162. $n = 2, s = 2, r = 3.$ The minimum cost is 5.0232 and it
took 0.8590 seconds to solve the problem in a MATLAB environment.\\

\subsection{Providing Initial Guess}


  The nonlinear programming problem is sensitive to the initial guess
  provided. The solution returned is the locally optimal solution.
  Computational time also greatly depends on the initial guess provided. Some
  of the choices are,

\begin{verbatim}
init = zeros(ncoeff,1); % All zero
init = ones(ncoeff,1);  % All unity
init = rand(ncoeff,1);  % Random numbers
\end{verbatim}


It is possible to construct initial coefficients from a trajectory.
This is shown in the robotic path planning example. In that problem,
the initial trajectory is assumed to be a straight line from $( x_0,
y_0 )$ to $( x_f, y_f )$, i.e.


\begin{verbatim}
Time = linspace(0,1,100);
xval = linspace(x0,xf,100);
yval = linspace(y0,yf,100);

We then fit splines to the data points with the number of intervals,
smoothness and order that was used to parameterise $x ( t )$ and $y
( t )$, i.e.


\begin{verbatim}
xsp = createGuess(x,Time,xval); % x = trajectory object used to parameterise x(t)
ysp = createGuess(y,Time,yval); % y = trajectory object used to parameterise y(t)
\end{verbatim}


  Variables \texttt{xsp,ysp} are spline objects that fit the data points
  \texttt{(t,xval)} and \texttt{(t,yval)}. Initial guess is constructed using
  the command,


  \verb¤init = [xsp.coefs ysp.coefs]';¤\\

  The initial guess must be a column vector. The sequence of coefficients
  corresponds to the trajectories in the trajectory list created using
  \texttt{trajList(...)}.


\subsection{Calling SNOPT}

The user is encouraged to read the SNOPT user manual to tweak the
solver. The OPTRAGEN examples demonstrate interface with SNOPT. An
example is as follows.\\

\texttt{EXAMPLE\\
x = solution of the optimisation problem. These are the coefficients
of the B-Splines.\\
\\
F = Vector containing the cost and constraint functions. F(1) is the
value of the objective. F(2:end) are the values of the constraint
functions.\\
\\
inform = returns the status of the optimisation problem. See SNOPT
manual for more information.\\
\\
init = initial guess for the problem.\\
xlow = lower bound on the parameters.\\
xupp = upper bound on the parameters.\\
\\
LB = lower bound of the cost and constraint functions. LB(1) = lower
bound of the cost function. LB(2:end) = lower bound of the
constraint functions.\\
\\
UB = upper bound of the cost and constraint functions. UB(1) = upper
bound of the cost function. UB(2:end) = upper bound of the
constraint functions.\\
\\
'ocp2nlp\_cost\_and\_constraint' = MATLAB function that is called by
the nonlinear solver. This function in turn calls the cost and
constraint functions defined by the user. The user should not edit
this file. }


\subsection{Plotting Results}

\texttt{PURPOSE \\Construct trajectory from B-Spline coefficients.\\
\\
SYNTAX\\ sp = getTrajSplines(nlp,x);\\
\\
sp = cell array of spline objects.\\
nlp = MATLAB object returned by ocp2nlp(...).\\
x = solution returned by SNOPT or any other solver.\\
\\
Sequence of trajectories in sp is the sequence of non-derivative
trajectories in the trajList(...).\\
\\
EXAMPLE\\
TL = trajList(x,xd,y,yd,ydd,z); \\
....\\
\% Call ocp2nlp(...) \\
\% Call SNOPT(...)\\
\\
sp = getTrajSplines(nlp,x); % Sequence of non deriv traj in TL is x,y,z\\
X = sp{1}; \% x trajectory\\
Y = sp{2}; \% y trajectory\\
Z = sp{3}; \% z trajectory\\
\\
Derivatives of splines are obtained as\\
Xd = fnder(X); Yd = fnder(Y); Zd = fnder(Z); \\
Xd,Yd and Zd are spline objects.\\
\\
To plot spline objects use command\\ fnplt(X); fnplt(Y); fnplt(Z);\\
\\
To get numerical values at sites TGrid,\\ Xval = fnval(X,TGrid);\\
\\
